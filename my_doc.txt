# Building a Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

This document explains how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, Qdrant, and Ollama. The goal is to enable a local LLM to answer questions using external knowledge stored in a vector database.

## 1. Overview

RAG combines two main steps: retrieval and generation. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from a knowledge base, while the generator (the LLM) produces a natural-language answer based on those chunks. Using a local stack keeps data private and reduces dependency on cloud APIs.

## 2. LangChain Integration

LangChain provides the building blocks for
